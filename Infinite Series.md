If terms of an arithmetic series are added without limit, it approaches infinity or negative infinity, and becomes a **divergent** series.

If terms of a geometric series are added without limit, they can become divergent as well, however they can also approach a finite number and become **convergent**.

In the equation

$$S_n=\frac{u_1(1-r^n)}{1-r}$$

If $-1<r<1$, the series is convergent.

Otherwise ($-1\geq r$ or $r\geq1$), the series is divergent.
