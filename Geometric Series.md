[[Series]], [[Sigma Notation]]

A geometric series $\{u_n\}$ can be defined as

$$u_n=u_1r^n$$

The sum of $\{u_n\}$ is $S_n$. It can be defined as 

$$S_n=\sum_{i=0}^{n}u_i$$

When $r<1$:

$$S_n=\frac{u_1(1-r^n)}{1-r}$$

When $r>1$:

$$S_n=\frac{u_1(r^n-1)}{r-1}$$
### Finding $r$
If at least two terms of $\{u_n\}$ are known (as $u_a$ and $u_b$), $r$ can be defined as:

$$r^{a-b}=\frac{u_a}{u_b}$$

If $r$ is known, $u_1$ can be defined as:

$$u_1=\frac{u_n}{r^{n-1}}$$
### Rules
If there is a geometric sequence $\{u_n\}$ defined as $u_n=u_1d^n$ and a boundary $u_m$, $m$ can be found with:

$$m=\log_d{\frac{u_m}{u_1}}$$
