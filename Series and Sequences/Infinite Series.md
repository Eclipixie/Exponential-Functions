If terms of an arithmetic series are added without limit, it approaches infinity or negative infinity, and becomes a **divergent** series.

If terms of a geometric series are added without limit, they can become divergent as well, however they can also approach a finite number and become **convergent**.
## [[Geometric Series|Geometric]]
As $n$ approaches infinity, the sum of a geometric series $\{S_n\}$ converges to

$$S_\infty=\frac{u_1}{1-r}$$

If $|r|<1$.
