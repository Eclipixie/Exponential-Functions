# Arithmetic Series

[[Series]], [[Sigma Notation]]

The sum of ${u_n}$ is $S_n$. It can be defined as

$$S_n=\sum_{r=1}^{n}u_r$$

Which equals

$$S_n=u_1n+d(\frac{n^2+n}{2})$$

## Finding $d$

If at least two terms of $\{u_n\}$ are known (as $u_a$ and $u_b$), $d$ can be defined as:

$$d(a-b)=u_a-u_b$$

If $d$ is known, $u_1$ can be defined as:

$$u_1=u_n-dn$$

## Rules

If there is an arithmetic series $\{u_n\}$ defined as $u_n=u_1+dn$, and a boundary $u_m$, $m$ can be defined as

$$m=\frac{u_m-u_1}{d}$$
