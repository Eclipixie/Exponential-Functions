# Series

$u_n$ is the $n\text{th}$ term of sequence $u$.
$\{u_n\}$ is considered the whole sequence.
A series is defined either recursively or absolutely.

* $u_{n+1}=u_n+d$ is the recursive definition for arithmetic series
* $u_n=u_1+dn$ is the absolute definition for arithmetic series
* $u_{n+1}=u_nd$ is the recursive definition for geometric series
* $u_n=u_1d^n$ is the absolute definition for geometric series
