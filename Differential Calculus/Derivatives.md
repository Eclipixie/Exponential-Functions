# Derivatives

The gradient of a tangent to a function at a point can be found with:

$$m=\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}=\frac{y_1-y_2}{x_1-x_2}$$

To find the gradient of a function at a given point, it is worth looking into derivatives.

The derivative of $f(x)$ is $f'(x)$. It is defined as:

$$f'(x)=\lim\limits_{h\to0}\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}$$

The derivative of $f'(x)$ can also be found using [[Derivation Rules]]
